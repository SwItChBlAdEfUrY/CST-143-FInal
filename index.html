                <p>Wall-E is a movie about a robot whose job it is is to clean up the earth after all humans have left it in the very distant future. Wall-E is alone other than a single cockroach. All humans have evacuate earth and have moved to a space ship, this pace ship periodically checks in on earth by sending a drone, named EVE. Wall-E becomes very interested in EVE and ultimately saves her from a storm. Wall-E then shows her a plant which she immediately seizes the plant and activates her return. </p>
                <p>In 1960 the us government was tasked to create a robust structured communications protocol between computers, they ultimately ended up creating the internet. Today the internet is used for many things, mainly for watching cat videos, however some people use if for more productive things, such as word processing, and data collection.</p>
                <p>The IT Fundamentals study guide is a study guide book that encompases a wide range of computer related hardware and software topics. This book goes into detail on a lot of computer related topics, for hardware topics such as, Core hardware components, Peripherals, networking technologies, and mobile devices. The book also covers software topics such as, Desktop operating systems, software applications, and even windows configuration.</p>

                <p>In today's society technology is very common, it comes in many different forms, such as televisions, laptops, computers and mobile devices. Most people have become accustomed to having it integrated into our daily lives, and couldn't survive a day without it. For example, your morning cup of coffee, that you literally cannot do anything without, is made using technology. Does that make technology a curse, or does that make our lives easier? I claim that it makes our lives easier.</p>
                <p>Without technology We wouldn't have things like movies, or pressurized water systems, or electricity. Entertainment is a big part of human life, without it our brains have no work to do, humans love entertainment. Technology helped make pressurized water systems, without that we wouldn't have skyscrapers, and with electricity comes light and heat, these things help humans make use of potentially unproductive times, such as night and winter.</p>
